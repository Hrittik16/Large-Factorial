Finding the factorial of a number is a pretty common problem

N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * (N-1) * N

But if the value of N is large enough then it becomes difficult for computing the factorial as in c++ long long variables can store
max 18 digit numbers.

100! has something nearly 160 digits.

So to solve this problem we will use arrays to store the digits after we interatively multiply them.
